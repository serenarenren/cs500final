  <h4>Self: A High School Collection</h4>
  <p class="text">
    (2014-2017)<br><br>
  </p>
  <h5>
    my high school journey documented through self-portraits<br><br>
  </h5>
  <p class="text">
    Many people take great comfort in putting up a mask to gain acceptance and avoid judgment. We strive for self-love by receiving the respect and confirmation of others. Funnily enough, though we grow to hate the exterior, we grow attached to the love others have expressed for this facade. We grow accustomed to the routine of donning our concealment every morning. Trouble is, as time goes on, the masks we put on break down — they shatter; they crack; they crumble. Revealed beneath is an afraid newborn, a stranger to the world ahead.
    <br><br>
    My work examines different forms these shields takes, and the process that lies behind their birth and deterioration. I applied my own experience growing up in boarding school, trying on different masks and searching for my true self while surrounded by friends, as the main inspiration. Additionally, my passion for psychology and behavioral science gave me the opportunity to examine adolescent behavior and social cognition with a scientific perspective and in more depth.

    Part of a series I drew called "Fragmented Figures," this piece examines the deterioration of putting on a facade. I applied my own experience growing up in boarding school, trying on different masks and searching for my true self while surrounded by friends, as the main inspiration.

    <br><br>This self-portrait reflects where I am in my self-discovery journey. I have learned so much from my experiences, my mistakes, and my peers. I have matured and have a deeper understanding of the world around me. However, there is still so much to learn which is why I left some of the canvas blank to be filled as I continue on my journey.
    <br><br>
    The barcode-like stripes also address the theme of self worth by connoting the act of labelling oneself.

    <br><br>This piece documents one of my memorable experiences on my journey through Andover. The heavy load of school work exhausted me and I found myself sleeping in the middle of studying in the school library, surrounded by silence and towering bookshelves.
