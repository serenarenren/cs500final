    Many people take great comfort in putting up a mask to gain acceptance and avoid judgment. We strive for self-love by receiving the respect and confirmation of others. Funnily enough, though we grow to hate the exterior, we grow attached to the love others have expressed for this facade. We grow accustomed to the routine of donning our concealment every morning. Trouble is, as time goes on, the masks we put on break down — they shatter; they crack; they crumble. Revealed beneath is an afraid newborn, a stranger to the world ahead.

    Part of a series I drew called "Fragmented Figures," this piece examines the deterioration of putting on a facade. I applied my own experience growing up in boarding school, trying on different masks and searching for my true self while surrounded by friends, as the main inspiration.

    Part of the series "Fragmented Figures," this drawing was inspired by the geometric shapes of broken mirror shards. Each piece represents a fragment of my identity.

    The AP Computer Science A course curriculum is compatible with many CS1 courses in colleges and universities. Some colleges and universities may organize their curricula in alternative ways, so that the topics of the AP Computer Science A course are spread over several college courses, with other topics from computer science interspersed.
